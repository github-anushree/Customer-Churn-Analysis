# Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard Case Study

# Overview
This project dives into the telecom industry to uncover the factors behind customer churn using Power BI. Using a Kaggle dataset, I developed an [interactive dashboard]( https://app.powerbi.com/links/j2vADp42Da?ctid=6c3a6b9e-a1bb-4e39-8899-b86d6898245e&pbi_source=linkShare&bookmarkGuid=4b5ffdc8-8b87-4f3b-bd5c-aa71be5c4b65) that visualizes key churn indicators, enabling better business decisions.

# What I Did
1.	Imported, cleaned, and transformed data in Power BI Desktop.
2.	Built multiple visual pages, including:
•	Churn Overview
•	Customer Demographics
•	Billing & Service Breakdown
•	Churn Patterns by Contract Type
3.	Used DAX for key metrics like churn percentage, tenure grouping, and average charges.
4.	Designed slicers and filters for an interactive, decision-friendly experience.

# Key Insights
•	Customers with month-to-month contracts churn the most.
•	Users with less than 1 year of tenure are at highest risk.
•	High monthly charges without bundled services or tech support = increased churn.
•	Certain service combinations, like fiber optic internet without streaming, showed spikes.

# Project Outcomes
•	Delivered a fully interactive, real-time dashboard for churn analysis.
•	Showcased strong skills in Power BI, data storytelling, and business understanding.
•	Project demonstrates my ability to turn complex data into actionable insights.

# Tools Used
•	Power BI Desktop
•	Power Query
•	DAX
•	Kaggle Dataset

# How to Use
•	Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
•	Explore dashboard tabs using slicers for custom views.
•	Use visual tooltips and filters to uncover churn trends.
